## A couple of questions to ask when doing due diligence

<code>This is still a draft - don't quote me too much on this</code>

### What do people say about this product?

One of the first things we can do is a simple web search for the product or service that we are trying to use. If there are good comments about the service online - perfect! At the same time, don't forget that many of the comments could be paid reviews, have been copywritten by marketing specialists, or could (in an extreme case) even be the result of a malware author creating fake reviews.

So in addition to a search on the open web, it's worth taking a look at places such as:
<br>

* Wired
* Ars Technica
* Hacker News (user generated submissions)
* Reddit (user generated submissions)
* The EFF documentation
* Infosec Twitter
* Organisations you trust (Freedom of the Press, EFF, etc.)
* People whom you trust
* And several others

<i>A quick example</i><br><br>

A website called objective-see claims to produce high-quality security software for MacOS. But how do we know that we can trust them?

A quick search shows us that users on Hacker News are quite big fans of this software. Finding any updates on Twitter is a bit more difficult. We had to <a href = "https://twitter.com/search?q=patrickwardle&src=typed_query" target = "_blank">search</a> for Patrick Wardle, the founder of the software, in order to figure out more details. A 10 min browse shows that Patrick is pretty well respected in the field, being cited by many different respected figures, as seen <a href = "https://twitter.com/MalwareJake/status/1245442270989627392" target = "_blank">here</a>, <a href = "https://twitter.com/bcrypt/status/1245472251895361536" target = "_blank">here</a> and <a href = "https://twitter.com/KimZetter/status/1214271890870587392" target="_blank">here</a>. Note that it might take a while to figure out how infosec Twitter works, and who's influential therein.

### Have this product's claims ever been challenged in court?

Sometimes, police or other authorities can come knocking on the door of a developer or software firm, asking for details about users. Sometimes, such information has been requested by a court, which means that a developer or company that does not comply risks a fine or prison sentence.

It's worth to do a couple of web searches that look at the name of the product or service you're trying to use, along with words such as *court case* or *subpoena*.

Don't forget, though, that court cases only reveal the information that the product owners were able or unable to share at the time. It's possible that they modified the product after the court claim. At the same time, a lack of any court cases or subpoenas does not necessarily mean that a product is insecure - it simply suggests that it has not been popular enough to have significant police interest or that such requests have been put forward in secret.

<p class = "infobox">
The Signal messenger received a court order some time ago which asked for plenty of user data. <a href = "https://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security/secrecy/new-documents-reveal-government-effort-impose-secrecy-encryption?redirect=blog/free-future/new-documents-reveal-government-effort-impose-secrecy-encryption-company" target = "_blank">They were only able to supply incredibly basic details</a>, such as when the number was registered, unable to provide any metadata on who messaged whom or message contents. Don't forget that they would be in huge trouble had they lied to the police and court - so we can assume that their claims about not collecting any user information are trustworthy. <br><br>
Something similar happened with a VPN called Private Internet Access (PIA), which was <a href = "https://www.scribd.com/doc/303226103/Fake-bomb-threat-arrest" target = "_blank">unable to provide any meaningful data for the FBI when requested</a>. Since the consequences of lying to the FBI can be pretty dire, it is safe to assume that PIA collects very little user data.

### In which country is the product and its developers based?

The jurisdiction in which a product, its developers, and servers are based can prove to be very important.
